# Minimum Operations  

This project calculates the minimum number of operations needed to create exactly `n` characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations in a text file.  

## Description  

Given a single character 'H', the allowed operations are:  
- **Copy All**: Copies all current characters.  
- **Paste**: Pastes the copied characters.  

The goal is to determine the fewest number of operations to reach exactly `n` characters in the editor.  

## Requirements  

- Python 3.4.3 or later  
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
